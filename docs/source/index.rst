Welcome to Supervised MultiModal Integration Tool's documentation
=================================================================

This package has been designed as an easy-to-use platform to estimate different mono- and multi-view classifiers' performances on a multiview dataset.

The main advantage of the platform is that it allows to add and remove a classifier without modifying its core code (the procedure is described thoroughly in this documentation).

This documentation consists in a short read me, with instructions to install and get started with SuMMIT, then several use cases to discover the features, and all the documented sources.

.. note::
    The documentation, the platform and the tests are constantly being updated.
    All the content labelled WIP is Work In Progress
