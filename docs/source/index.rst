Welcome to MultiviewPlatform's documentation!
=============================================

This package is used as an easy-to-use platform to estimate different mono- and multi-view classifiers' performance on a multiview dataset.

The main advantage of the platform is that it allows to add and remove a classifier without modifying its core code (the procedure is described thoroughly in this documentation).
