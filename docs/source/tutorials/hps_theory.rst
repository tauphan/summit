Hyper-parameter 101
============================


Hyper-parameters intuition
-----------------------------------------

Hyper-parameters are parameters of a classifier (monoview or multiview) that are
task-dependant and have a huge part in the performance of the algorithm for a given task.

The simplest example is the decision tree. One of it's hyper-parameter is the
depth of the tree. The deeper the tree is, the most it will fit on the learning data. However, a tree too deep will most likely overfit and won't have any relevance on
unseen testing data.

This platform proposes a randomized search and a grid search to optimize
hyper-parameters. In this example, we first will analyze the theory and
then how to use it.


Understanding train/test split
------------------------------

In order to provide robust results, this platform splits the dataset in a
training set, that will be used by the classifier to optimize their
hyper-parameter and learn a relevant model, and a testing set that will take
no part in the learning process and serve as unseen data to estimate each
model's generalization capacity.

This split ratio is controlled by the config file's argument ``split:``. It uses a float to pass the ratio between the size of the testing set and the training set  :
:math:`\text{split} = \frac{\text{test size}}{\text{dataset size}}`. In order to be as fair as possible, this split is made by keeping the ratio between each class in the training set and in the testing set.

So if a dataset has 100 examples with 60% of them in class A, and 40% of them in class B, using ``split: 0.2``
will generate a training set with 48 examples of class A and 32 examples of class B and a testing set
with 12 examples of class A and 8 examples of class B.

Ths process uses sklearn's StratifiedShuffleSplit_ to split the dataset at random while being reproductible thanks to the random_state.

Understanding hyper-parameter optimization
------------------------------------------

As hyper-parameters are task dependant, there are three ways in the platform to set their value :

- If you know the value (or a set of values), specify them at the end of the config file for each algorithm you want to test, and use :yaml:`hps_type: 'None'` in the `config file <https://gitlab.lis-lab.fr/baptiste.bauvin/multiview-machine-learning-omis/-/blob/master/multiview_platform/examples/config_files/config_example_2_1_1.yml#L61>`_. This will bypass the optimization process to run the algorithm on the specified values.
- If you have several possible values in mind, specify them in the config file and use ``hps_type: 'Grid'`` to run a grid search on the possible values.
- If you have no ideas on the values, the platform proposes a random search for hyper-parameter optimization.

Grid search
<<<<<<<<<<<

The grid search is useful when one has several possible sets of hyper-parameters to test, as it is faster thant random-search but requires a relevant prior on the classification task.

In order to use grid search in |platf|, one has to specify ``hps_type: "Grid"`` in the config file and provide the values for each parameter of each algorithm in ``hps_args:``.
For example, let us suppose that one wants to run a decision tree but wants to try several depth values (1,5,10), then one has to specify in the config file :

.. code-block:: yaml

    hps_type: "Grid"
    hps_args:
      decision_tree:
        max_depth: [1,5,10]

For more complex classifiers this process can be quite long, but it allows a shorter computational time.


Random search
<<<<<<<<<<<<<

The random search is one of the most efficient while fairest method to optimize hyper-parameter without any prior knowledge on the dataset.
Thus, for each algorithm in the platform, each of its hyper-parameter is provided with a distribution of possible values,
(for example, the decision tree's max depth parameter is provided with a uniform distribution between 1 and 300).
The random search method will randomly select hyper-parameters within this distribution and evaluate the performance of
the classifier with this configuration. It will repeat that process with different randomly selected sets of
hyper-parameter and keep the best configuration performance-wise.

In the config file, to enable random search, set the ``hps_type:`` line to ``hps_type: "Random"``.
The the randomized search can be configured with two arguments :

.. code-block:: yaml

    hps_type: "Random"
    hps_args:
      n_iter: 5
      equivalent_draws: True

The ``n_iter`` parameter controls the number of random draws for each classifier
and if ``equivalent_draws`` is set to ``True``, then the multiview classifiers
will be allowed :math:`\text{n\_iter} \times \text{n\_views}` iterations,
to compensate the fact that they have to solve a musch more complex problem than the monoview ones.

K-folds cross-validation
<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<

During the process of optimizing the hyper-parameters, the random search has to estimate the performance of each classifier.

To do so, the platform uses k-folds cross-validation. This method consists in splitting the training set in
:math:`k` equal sub-sets, training the classifier (with the hyper-parameters to evaluate) on :math:`k-1` subsets an
testing it on the last one, evaluating it's predictive performance on unseen data.

This learning-and-testing process is repeated :math:`k` times and the estimated performance is the mean of the
performance on each testing set.

In the platform, the training set (the 48 examples of class A and 32 examples of class B from last example) will be
divided in k folds for the cross-validation process and the testing set (the 12 examples of class A and 8 examples of
class B for last examples) will in no way be involved in the training process of the classifier.

The cross-validation process can be controlled with the ``nb_folds:`` line of the configuration file in which the number
of folds is specified.

Metric choice
<<<<<<<<<<<<<

This hyper-parameter optimization can be strongly metric-dependant. For example, for an unbalanced dataset, evaluating
the accuracy is not relevant and will not provide a good estimation of the performance of the classifier.
In the platform, it is possible to specify the metric that will be used for the hyper-parameter optimization process
thanks to the ``metric_princ:`` line in the configuration file.
